# Project-2
# This project presents the development of a versatile, multi-functional calculator application using Python's Tkinter library. Unlike standard calculators, this "Multimode" version allows users to switch between different operational interfaces, such as: 
Standard Mode: Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Scientific Mode: Advanced functions including square roots, factorials, and trigonometric calculations.
Specialty Modes: Features such as area/geometry calculations or unit conversions.
